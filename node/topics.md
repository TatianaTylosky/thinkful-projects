### Building Web servers in Node with Express - Completed
- Beginner
- Create a server using Express and learn how Node deals with request and response objects.

### Building APIs with Node
- Beginner
- Build a RESTful Node API to power a shopping list application. You'll learn to handle all four CRUD requests types, and more.

### Thinking in Node
- Beginner
- Working in JS on the server is different than working on JS on the client. This project covers those key differences, for example not building utilities or classes that maintain global state between users.

### Asynchronous Programming Patterns - in progress
- Intermediate
- Learn to avoid _callback hell_ while processing a series of text files asynchronously. Use new features including promises, generators, and async.

### MEAN Gone Relational - Postgres, Express, Angular, Node
- Intermediate
- Build a CRUD single page app with Node, Express, Angular, and PostgreSQL (along with Sequelize). Example - [blog post](http://mherman.org/blog/2015/02/12/postgresql-and-nodejs), [repo](https://github.com/mjhea0/node-postgres-todo).

### Lodash - In Progress
- Intermediate
- This project tasks you with practicing some of the functional programming library's most useful features, such as its collection methods (find, where, pluck, pick) and its function methods (throttle, debounce, delay, partial, wrap, once, bindAll).

### Plugging Memory Leaks - In progress
- Intermediate
- Stop the leaking memory! Clone a starter project and get garbage collection running to improve your app's performance.

### Building applications with Hapi.js
- Intermediate
- Get comfortable with the core features of Hapi.js, one of the more popular Node frameworks.

### Using and Building NPM Modules â€“ In progress
- Intermediate
- If you use Node, you depend on NPM, the package manager for Node. Learn to use NPM and publish your own NPM packages.

### Using Error Objects - In Progress
- Intermediate
- Error objects are first class citizens in Node and are using everywhere to handle undesirable scenarios (e.g., error first callbacks). Learn how to use them effectively, and when/where to throw them.

### Deploying Node apps
- Advanced
- Learn to deploy Node apps: from simple side-projects to large scale applications with complicated dependencies. Practice deploying to Digital Ocean or AWS, and set up continuous deployment to simplify your workflow.

### Node Streams
- Advanced
- Streams let you read large quantities of data from a source and pipe it to a destination as it arrives, delivering content to your users faster.

### Logging, Metrics, and Monitoring Production
- Advanced
- Learn what the difference is between logging and metrics, and how to effectively monitor your production instances. When things do inevitably go wrong, have a game plan to be able to get visibility into what your application is doing.

### Chatroom with Node & React
- Advanced
- Build a chatroom using React and Node with Socket.io to learn real-time development best practices.
