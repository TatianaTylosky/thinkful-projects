Level: Intermediate

Time: 4 hours

Goals: Publish and use your own npm packages.

Concepts: npm, package.json, sinopia

Pre-reqs: command line, JavaScript, JSON

##Project Brief

You have just created a sweet new node package, but it's name is already taken in the npm registry?  No worries!  It is possible to run your own npm registry.  This can be useful if you don't want to share your code publicly, or when your package name is already taken.

npm config:
* going through a proxy server
* setting a custom registry
* using a proxy
* use a certain group when running package scripts
* setting the default prefix (currently is ^)
* devDependencies, dependencies, optionalDependencies
* shrinkwrap
* node_module lookup
* npmrc files



##Milestones
