### Resources

* For a high-level recap of references in JavaScript take a look at [this chapter of JavaScript Allong√©](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/js-allonge-book/blob/master/content/3_References%20and%20Rebinding/content.md)
* [This article](http://www.nearform.com/nodecrunch/self-detect-memory-leak-node/) introduces two Node.js modules which can be used to detect memory leaks in a Node application.  Note that the version of Memwatch linked by the article is outdated.  You should use [this fork](https://github.com/marcominetti/node-memwatch) instead.
* The Chrome memory profiler can help you visualize how memory is being used in your application.  There is information about how to use the profiles, plus some useful information about how memory is stored and free in [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-memory-profiling)
* [This article from Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2014/11/nodejs-in-flames.html) has a great account of finding an fixing a memory leak in a Node.js app.

### Footnotes

(*) Programmer Joke Alert: This one relies on you knowing that a [cryptographic hash function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) is almost definitely a bad choice for implementing a Bidirectional Hashmap, a data-structure which has very little to do with secrecy and security.
