### CSS Animation, CSS Pre-processors

Warning: Not for epileptics!

Level: Intermediate

Topics: CSS, SASS, Frontend, Fun

Time: 2 Hours

## Project Brief

You've organized a party at your apartment, when suddenly you realize the ambience just doesn't cut it.
But you have a projector! It's bright, and you know CSS can make an awesome visualizer. It's your party,
you might step as well up to the challenge and make a fun visualizer yourself.

In this project, we'll be building a CSS animation with many elements. Using CSS for this is somewhat intensive
on your computer, and we suggest you constrain your experiments to about 200px by 200px.

Your task is to build a visualization that changes color over time with 10-100 elements. First off, we'll make one *CSS animation* to have one
element flash color. You can start with black and white, but play with animating different colors and color modes.
Then apply this animation to a bunch of elements in a grid. Once you
have one animation going, we'll
find out how to select each element using *nth-child* selector using a loop in SASS/SCSS. Lastly, we'll shift the animation to create a pattern using with a different *animation-delay* on each of the 10-100 elements.

If you aren't familiar with backends and deploying websites, you should build your animation on *Codepen*.

In the end, only you know the right ambience for your party. Bright neon? Suble earth tones?

### Bonus

Before you submit your animation, consider a few (optional) next steps:

* [CSS] Make it round, like a disco ball!
* [CSS] Add a second animation and use a CSS filter to rotate the hue of your original animation.
* [Frontend] Add an `<audio>` tag with your favorite 80's hit to play in the background!
* [Javascript, Challenge] Add a control to adjust different parameters of your animation. ProTip: This means your javascript has to generate the CSS, not SASS or LESS.
* [Javascript, Challenge] Create a similar animation using a `<canvas>` tag.
* [Fun] Taking a photo of it lighting up the party in your living room.

## Setup

To handle more than just a few selectors, you will need to use a CSS pre-processor like SASS or LESS. These
are available on codepen using the cogwheel next to *CSS*. If you're coding it yourself, it helps to have the Emmet extension so we can make 50 elements with one keystroke, it's built in to Codepen (tab key). 

## Steps
1. [nth-child] Use nth-child to give the second element a different color.
2. ....
